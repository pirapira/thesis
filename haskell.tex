\chapter{Hypersequents in Haskell}
\label{ch:haskell}

\subsection{Summary}

 We investigate the computational meaning of hypersequents and realize
 it as a Haskell library.
 Hypersequent calculus is introduced by mathematical logicians in order
 to obtain cut-free deduction systems for more logics.
 However, its
 computational meaning has been unknown.  We propose using hypersequents
 for representing asynchronous communication.  Logically, a hypersequent
 means every model satisfies at least one clause of it.
 Computationally, a hypersequent
 means every execution makes at least one clause
 successful.
 We use this analogy
 for waitfreely communicating threads.  This is useful
 because typical waitfree protocols use the fact that at least one thread
 can successfully read other thread's information.

\section{Introduction}

We used hypersequents to describe waitfree computation in order to
conquer two difficulties:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item the standard description of waitfreedom~\cite{multiprocessor}
is imperative so there is a difficulty in
expressing waitfree computation in declarative manner;
 \item  on the
other hand, the technique of hypersequents has not found an
application in typed lambda calculi setting (i.e. via Curry-Howard correspondence).
\end{enumerate}
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by implementing it on
Haskell%
\footnote{\texttt{cabal install waitfree} will install this library.}.

\subsection{Waitfreedom}
\label{subsect:wf}

Waitfreedom is a notion arisen in the theory of asynchronous
communication. Since waitfreedom provides no synchronization, it has
served as a basis for comparing different synchronization primitives.
The intuition of waitfreedom is simple: a thread cannot
wait for another thread.  Suppose there are a finite number of threads and they can
communicate using a store. They can
visit the store, put and take things on the store and then leave the
store. The problem is that the thread's movements can be arbitrarily
slow: they can delay for unspecified amount of time and the threads
have no control over the delay. Waitfreedom prohibits a thread from
waiting for another; that is, a thread cannot choose to stay at the
store until some another thread comes to the store; nor can a thread
keep visiting the store until another thread comes to the store.  The
latter restriction can be formalized as existence of a constant natural
number~$k$ so
that no thread visits the store more than
$k$-times in any execution.  So, when a thread consumes all permitted
visits to the store, it has to give up receiving anything yet to come
from
other threads.

This notion of waitfreedom is originally imperative: involving reads from and writes to
the memory and the ordering of events.  In other words, this definition
describes \textit{how} waitfree computation works but it is hard to deduce from
this notion \textit{what} waitfree computation computes.
The merit of using a functional programming language, especially a pure
one like Haskell, is emphasized if the program describes \textit{what}
rather than \textit{how} it computes.

Concrete examples give a useful intuition for modeling what waitfree
protocols can compute.
Suppose a thread has a value~$v$ and another has~$w$.
It is waitfreely impossible for the two threads to exchange their
possessions.  Instead, there is a waitfree protocol for them to ensure
that either $w$ is passed to the second thread or $v$ is passes to the
first thread.
In other words, only one-way communication is guaranteed.  We are going
to exploit this property when formulating waitfree computation with hypersequents.


\subsection{Hypersequents}

Type derivations are commonly used to define what program has what
type.  Here is a typical derivation rule.
\begin{center}
 \AxiomC{$\Gamma\tr \tj s{A\rightarrow B}$}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma\tr \tj t A$}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma\tr \tj{st} B$}
\DisplayProof
\end{center}
A sequent $\Gamma\tr \tj t A$ contains a list of typed variables on the
left hand side ant a term~$t$ with a type~$A$ on the right hand side.
It means, when the free variables in~$t$ are typed according to
$\Gamma$, the whole term~$t$ can be typed as $A$.

A hypersequent is a finite sequence of sequents and a derivation
looks like this.  Each hypersequent consists of a finite number of
sequents called components\index{component}.  Rules from ordinary sequent calculus
can be accommodated in a hypersequent calculus by allowing external
contexts from different branches to merge simply.  The derivation below
is based on such an accommodated rule.
\begin{center}
\AxiomC{$\Delta\tr\tj u C\hmid \Gamma\tr \tj s {A\rightarrow B}$}
\AxiomC{$\Theta\tr\tj v D\hmid \Gamma\tr \tj t A$}
\BinaryInfC{$\Delta\tr\tj u C\hmid \Theta\tr\tj v D\hmid
\Gamma\tr\tj{st}B$}
\DisplayProof
\end{center}

The hypersequent below the line means that at least one component will be
successful.
More formally, a hypersequent
$\Gamma_0\vdash\varphi_0\hmid\Gamma_1\vdash\varphi_1\hmid\cdots\hmid
\Gamma_n\vdash\varphi_n$ is semantically equivalent to the formula
$\left(\bigwedge\Gamma_0\rightarrow\varphi_0\right)\vee\left(\bigwedge\Gamma_1\rightarrow\varphi_1\right)\vee\cdots\vee\left(\bigwedge
\Gamma_n\rightarrow\varphi_n\right)$.
Since a hypersequent can be interpreted as a logical formula,
hypersequents do not strengthen the expressivity of a logic.
Expressivity was not the reason for introducing hypersequents, but the
cut-elimination theorem was the motivation.
\citet{RM} introduced hypersequents in order to give a cut-free
Gentzen-type deduction system for a logic called \textbf{RM}.
  \citet*{alg} found an algorithm for obtaining a hypersequent
deduction system for each of an infinite class of axioms and further
shown that those hypersequent deduction systems enjoy cut-elimination
theorem.

From this perspective, the merit of this paper is finding an
application for hypersequents via Curry--Howard isomorphism.
Hypersequents are roughly a sequence of
typed terms.  They are only introduced as an apparatus for obtaining
cut-elimination theorems for more logics than simple sequents provide.

\subsection{Connection}

In waitfree protocol, two threads can communicate in one-way fashion,
and it is decided at execution time which one can send information to
the other.  This phenomenon can be understood as a set of computations
of which at least one is guaranteed to be successful.  Such a set of
computations can be represented as a hypersequent.
\verb@K s a@ as thread \verb@s@'s computation yielding a value of type \verb@a@ and
\verb@K t b@ as thread \verb@t@'s computation yielding a value of type \verb@b@,
the waitfree protocol described at the end of Subsection~\ref{subsect:wf}
witnesses the following derivation because either \verb@t@ obtains \verb@b@ or \verb@s@
obtains \verb@a@ after executing the protocol.
\begin{center}
 \AxiomC{\tt K t a}
 \AxiomC{\tt K s b}
 \BinaryInfC{$\mathtt{K t b}\hmid \mathtt{K s a}$}
 \DisplayProof
\end{center}
However, this derivation only contains types but not programs.  In this
paper, we are going to propose how to write a program belonging to this
type in Haskell.

\section{An Example Program}

\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{spec}
handle :: PortID -> IO Handle
handle p = withSocketsDo $ do
  s <- listenOn p
  (h,\_,\_) <- accept s
  hSetBuffering h NoBuffering
  return h

prepareHandle :: Thread t => PortID -> IO (K t Handle :*: HNil)
prepareHandle p = single $ handle p

readLine :: Thread t => t -> Handle -> IO ((Handle, String), String)
readLine th h = do
  hPutStr h $ (show $ atid th) ++ " requiring input: "
  str <- hGetLine h
  return ((h, str), str)

readH :: Thread t => PortID -> IO (K t ((Handle, String), String) :*: HNil)
readH p = prepareHandle p >>= (readLine -*- return)

printTaken :: Thread t => t -> ((Handle, String), String) -> IO ()
printTaken th ((h, selfs), peers) = do
        hPutStrLn h $ (show $ atid th) ++ " got: " ++ show (selfs, peers)
        return ()

twoPrints :: K ZeroT ((Handle, String), String) :*: K (SucT ZeroT) ((Handle, String), String) :*: HNil
              -> IO (K ZeroT () :*: K (SucT ZeroT) () :*: HNil)
twoPrints = printTaken -*- printTaken -*- return

rerror :: Thread t => t -> (Handle, a) -> IO ()
rerror th (h, _) = hPutStrLn h $ "Thread " ++ (show $ atid th) ++ " failed to read peer's input."

content ::  IO (K ZeroT () :*: K (SucT ZeroT) () :*: HNil)
content = comm (readH $ PortNumber 6000) rerror (readH $ PortNumber 6001) rerror >>= twoPrints

main :: IO ()
main = execute content
\end{spec}
 \caption[An example program that provides waitfree communication to two
 clients.]
 {An example program.  This spawns two threads each waiting for
 a TCP connection.  The two threads do waitfree communication, so the
 slowest thread obtains the inputs for all threads. }
 \label{fig:example}
\end{figure*}

We show an example program written with this library
(Fig.~\ref{fig:example}).  This is a concrete realization of the
simplest nontrivial waitfree computation described at the end of Subsection~\ref{subsect:wf}.

\paragraph{The external behavior.}
  This program can be compiled and executed as:
\begin{verbatim}
% ghc --make -threaded waitfree_test.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main
Linking waitfree_test ...
% ./waitfree_test
\end{verbatim}
Then, it spawns two threads listening on port 6000 and 6001.  If we
connect to the first thread on port 6000 and
give input, the first thread tries to obtain the input for the other
thread but fails to do so and aborts.  Below, we omit the outputs of
\texttt{telnet} for clarity.
\begin{verbatim}
% telnet localhost 6000
0 requiring input: apple
Thread 0 failed to read peer's input.
\end{verbatim}
When we connect to the second thread on port 6001 and give another
input,
the second thread obtains the input given to the first thread and displays
both inputs.
\begin{verbatim}
% telnet localhost 6001
1 requiring input: orange
Thread 1 got: ("orange\r","apple\r")
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{The internal behavior}

Both thread 0 and 1 writes its input into the shared memory and then
tries to read the other thread's input from the shared memory.  When
a thread tries to read what the other thread has not written, the read
is aborted.  The reading thread do not wait for the other thread's write
operation.

We assume sequential consistency.  Sequential consistency is an illusion
sustained by shared memory mechanism that pretends to align all memory
operations in a totally ordered sequence.  In this case, there are
six possible such ordered sequences.
\begin{itemize}
 \item 0 writes, 0 reads, 1 writes and 1 reads.  Then, 1 reads 0's write.
 \item 0 writes, 1 writes, 0 reads and 1 reads.  Both reads the other.
 \item 0 writes, 1 writes, 1 reads and 0 reads.  Both reads the other.
 \item 1 writes, 0 writes, 0 reads and 1 reads.  Both reads the other.
 \item 1 writes, 0 writes, 1 reads and 0 reads.  Both reads the other.
 \item 1 writes, 1 reads, 0 writes and 0 reads.  Then, 0 reads 1's write.
\end{itemize}
In either case, either thread 0 obtains thread 1's input or 1 obtains
0's input.

\paragraph{The source code.}

We look at the source code of this sample program.

An obvious thing to do is to establish a TCP connection.  This is done
by a function called \verb@handle@.
\begin{spec}
handle :: PortID -> IO Handle
handle p = withSocketsDo $ do
  s <- listenOn p
  (h,_,_) <- accept s
  hSetBuffering h NoBuffering
  return h
\end{spec}
Since this connection establishment should be done by a thread,
we prepare a hypersequent containing this computation.  For that, we can use
a library function~\verb@single@ that creates a hypersequent containing
a single component.
\begin{spec}
prepareHandle :: Thread t =>
                 PortID -> IO (K t Handle :*: HNil)
prepareHandle p = single $ handle p
\end{spec}

The next thing to do is asking the user to provide an input.
In doing that, showing the name of the current thread is useful.
When a type~\verb@t@ is of the type class~\verb@Thread@, we can obtain the
thread's number via \verb@atid@ function (\verb@atid@ stands for Abstract Thread
ID).
\begin{spec}
readLine :: Thread t =>
            t -> Handle -> IO ((Handle, String), String)
readLine th h = do
  hPutStr h $ (show $ atid th) ++ " requiring input: "
  str <- hGetLine h
  return ((h, str), str)
\end{spec}
The result of this interaction is stored in a tuple \verb@((h, str), str)@,
whose left part contains things to be used locally, and whose right
part contains things to be used remotely in the other thread.

This distinction of local and remote usage is apparent in the type of
\verb@comm@ function, which provides the simplest waitfree communication.
\begin{spec}
comm :: (Thread s, Thread t, HAppend l l' l'') =>
         IO (K t (b,a) :*: l)
         -> IO (K s (d,c) :*: l')
         -> IO (K t (b, c) :*: K s (d, a) :*: l'')
\end{spec}
The \verb@comm@ function assumes that the types \verb@s@ and \verb@t@ are \verb@Thread@s and
that a hypersequent \verb@l''@ is the concatenation of \verb@l@ and \verb@l'@.
Under this assumption, the function takes two hypersequents in \verb@IO@
monad and returns
a hypersequent in \verb@IO@ monad.
The first argument says either \verb@t@'s computation of a value of type
\verb@(b,a)@ or one of the components of the hypersequent~\verb@l@ succeeds.
The second argument says the same thing for \verb@s@'s \verb@(d,c)@ and \verb@l'@.
If any component in \verb@l@ or \verb@l'@ is successful, that component witnesses the
resulting hypersequent.  Otherwise, when
thread \verb@t@
computes \verb@(b,a)@ value and
\verb@s@ computes \verb@(d,c)@ value successfully, the \verb@comm@ function guarantees either
\verb@t@ obtains the \verb@c@ value or \verb@s@ obtains the \verb@a@ value.  The \verb@b@ value
and the \verb@d@ value are only used locally.  Without this distinction of
local and remote usage, the TCP connections would be communicated
together with the inputs so that the connections are not closed until all
threads terminates.

The final agenda is to output the obtained inputs.  This is done by the
\verb@printTaken@ function.
Similarly to \verb@readLine@ function, the \verb@printTaken@ function takes the
thread and the result of the last computation.

Everything is wrapped up into a hyperseqeunt~\verb@content@ of the type
\verb@IO (K ZeroT () :*: K (SucT ZeroT) () :*: HNil)@
and it is \verb@execute@d.  The content of \verb@execute@ function is explained in
the next section.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{What is a Hypersequent}
We expressed hypersequents as heterogeneous collections by \citet{hetero}
with a slight modification.  We required each element to be a thread's
computation.
We expressed threads as type level natural numbers, which is obtained by
simplifying heterogeneous lists.
Each thread is expressed as a singleton type containing a single value.
When that value is passed to the \verb@atid@ function, the function returns
an \verb@AbstractThreadId@, which is tentatively defined to be \verb@Int@.
\begin{code}
class Thread t where
    t :: t
    atid :: t -> AbstractThreadId

data ZeroT = ZeroT
instance Thread ZeroT where
    t = ZeroT
    atid ZeroT = 0

data SucT t = SucT t
instance Thread t => Thread (SucT t) where
    t = SucT t
    atid (SucT x) = succ $ atid x

type AbstractThreadId = Int
\end{code}
Thread~\verb@t@'s computation of type~\verb@a@ is represented as \verb@K t a@.
Internally, it is a pair of thread and a computation of \verb@JobStatus a@.
A \verb@JobStatus@ can be \verb@Done TryAnotherJob@ or \verb@Done Finished@ after the
thread fails to read from the shared memory.
\begin{code}
newtype K t a = K (t, IO (JobStatus a))

data JobStatus a = Having a | Done ThreadStatus
data ThreadStatus = TryAnotherJob | Finished
\end{code}
A hypersequent is either \verb@HNil@ or \verb@HCons (K t e) l@ where \verb@l@ is a
hypersequent.  This inductive definition realizes the idea of a
heterogeneous list of threads' computations.  This construction is an
adaptation of \citep{hetero}.
\begin{code}
class HyperSequent l

data HNil = HNil
instance HyperSequent HNil

data HCons e l = HCons e l
instance HyperSequent l =>
  HyperSequent (HCons (K t e) l)

infixr 5 :*:
type e :*: l = HCons e l
\end{code}
In our framework, every hypersequent is contained in IO monad
so that hypersequent derivations can contain MVar
cells. The MVar cells are used for implementing the communication
rule. Although we use MVar cells, which are capable of supporting full
synchronization among threads, we only use a limited set of functions
that only allows waitfree communication. For instance, we do not use
\verb@takeMVar@ or \verb@putMVar@ because they are blocking operations.

\subsection{How to Execute a Hypersequent}
Of course we can execute a hypersequent after we construct it.  The
execution takes three steps: preparing computations, spawning
threads and waiting for them.

After a hypersequent derivation is constructed, it is turned into a list
of local computations.  The type \verb@L@ is internally used to represent a
local computation.  Each computation results in either \verb@TryAnotherJob@
or \verb@Finished@.  These decide whether the thread continues to operate or stops.
\begin{code}
type L = (AbstractThreadId, IO ThreadStatus)
\end{code}

Local computations are then transformed into a finite map from thread
identifiers to channels containing computations. Each thread reads the list for
its own identifier and execute the computations in the list one by one.
\begin{code}
class Lconvertible l where
    htol :: l -> [L]

instance Lconvertible HNil where
    htol _ = []

instance (Thread t, Lconvertible l) =>
 Lconvertible (HCons (K t ThreadStatus) l) where
    htol (HCons (K (th, result)) rest) =
      (atid th, fmap jth2th result) : htol rest

jth2th :: JobStatus ThreadStatus -> ThreadStatus
jth2th (Having x) = x
jth2th (Done x) = x
\end{code}

We construct a list of computations for each thread.  The lists are
called \verb@JobChannel@s.  The \verb@JobChannel@s are put in a finite map called
\verb@JobPool@.  The \verb@JobPool@ maps each \verb@AbstractThreadId@ to a
\verb@JobChannel@.  Later, the worker threads look at this map to take jobs.
\begin{code}
type JobChannel = [IO ThreadStatus]

type JobPool =
    Map.Map AbstractThreadId JobChannel

constructJobPool :: [L] -> JobPool
constructJobPool [] = Map.empty
constructJobPool ((aid, action) : tl) =
  Map.insertWith (++) aid [action] rest
     where
       rest = constructJobPool tl
\end{code}

At last, threads are spawned.  Each thread's operation is defined in
\verb@worker@ function.  It takes two arguments.  The first argument is a
channel containing jobs.  The other argument is a MVar cell for telling
termination.
\begin{code}
worker :: JobChannel -> MVar () -> IO ()
worker [] fin = tryPutMVar fin () >>= \_ -> return ()
worker (hd : tl) fin = do
  result <- hd
  case result of
    TryAnotherJob -> worker tl fin
    Finished -> tryPutMVar fin () >>= \_ -> return ()
\end{code}

When the main thread spawns the worker threads, it has their
\verb@ThreadId@s and the termination MVar cells in a finite map.
After spawning the worker threads, the main thread waits for each
thread to terminate and then kills it.
\begin{code}
type ThreadPool =
    Map.Map AbstractThreadId (ThreadId, MVar ())

threadSpawn :: AbstractThreadId -> JobChannel ->
 IO ThreadPool -> IO ThreadPool
threadSpawn aid ch p = do
    p' <- p
    fin <- newEmptyMVar
    thid <- forkIO $ worker ch fin
    return $ Map.insert aid (thid, fin) p'

waitThread :: ThreadPool -> IO ()
waitThread = Map.fold threadWait $ return ()

threadWait :: (ThreadId, MVar ()) -> IO () -> IO ()
threadWait (thid, fin) w = do
    readMVar fin
    killThread thid
    w
\end{code}

At last, everything is wrapped up into a function called \verb@execute@.
\begin{code}
execute :: Lconvertible l => IO l -> IO ()
execute ls = do
  ls >>= run . constructJobPool . htol >>= waitThread

run :: JobPool -> IO ThreadPool
run = Map.foldrWithKey threadSpawn $ return Map.empty
\end{code}

\subsection{How to Construct a Hypersequent}
Since a hypersequent represents a finite multiset of computations of which
at least one succeeds, there cannot be an empty hypersequent.  Thus, the
simplest hypersequent is a hypersequent consisting of a single component.
This can be build with \verb@single@ function.
\begin{code}
single :: Thread t => (t -> IO a) -> IO (K t a :*: HNil)
single f = return $ HCons (remote $ f t) HNil
  where
    remote y = K (t, fmap Having y)
\end{code}

As we want to regard a hypersequent as a multiset of components, we allow
permutation and concatenation of hypersequents.
First, \verb@exchange@ function changes the positions of the first two
components:
\begin{code}
exchange :: K t a :*: K s b :*: l ->
            IO (K s b :*: K t a :*: l)
exchange (HCons x (HCons y rest)) =
  return $ HCons y $ HCons x rest
\end{code}
Second, \verb@cycling@ functions puts the last component in the first position.
In order to implement this function, we defined a type class called
\verb@HLast@.
The type class instance \verb@HLast l a heads@ means that the hypersequent \verb@l@
is a concatenation of \verb@heads@ and a singleton list made of \verb@a@.  In
other words, the last element of \verb@l@ is \verb@a@ and the rest is \verb@heads@.
This tactic of defining a type class is taken from the paper for
heterogeneous collections~\citep{hetero}.
By \verb@exchange@ and \verb@cycling@, we can perform all permutations of
hypersequents.
\begin{code}
class HLast l a heads | l -> a, l -> heads
 where hLast :: l -> (a, heads)

instance HLast (HCons a HNil) a HNil
    where hLast (HCons x HNil) = (x, HNil)

instance (HLast (HCons lh ll) a heads) =>
  (HLast (HCons b (HCons lh ll)) a (HCons b heads))
    where hLast (HCons y rest) =
              case hLast rest of
                (x, oldheads) -> (x, HCons y oldheads)
cycling_ :: HLast l a heads => l -> HCons a heads
cycling_ lst = case hLast lst of
                (last_, heads) -> HCons last_ heads

cycling :: HLast l last heads =>
  IO l -> IO (HCons last heads)
cycling = fmap cycling_
\end{code}
Finally, we provide concatenation of hypersequents with \verb@follows@
function.
Again, we prepare a type class called \verb@HAppend@ for this.
\begin{code}
follows :: HAppend l l' l'' => IO l -> IO l' -> IO l''
follows l0 l1 = do
  h0 <- l0
  h1 <- l1
  return $ hAppend h0 h1

class HAppend l l' l'' | l l' -> l''
 where hAppend :: l -> l' -> l''

instance HyperSequent l => HAppend HNil l l
 where hAppend HNil = id

instance (HyperSequent l, HAppend l l' l'')
    => HAppend (HCons x l) l' (HCons x l'')
 where hAppend (HCons x l) = HCons x. hAppend l
\end{code}

In addition to simple permutations of hypersequents, we have another
structural rule called external contraction.  When a hypersequent begins
with two componentss of the same type, they can be merged into one.  The
resulting component represents the computation of trying the original
components one by one until one of them is successful.
\begin{code}
choice :: Thread t => K t a :*: K t a :*: l -> IO (K t a :*: l)
choice (HCons (K (_, comp0))
  (HCons (K (_, comp1)) rest)) =
  return $ HCons (K (t, result)) rest
  where
    result = do
      r0 <- comp0
      case r0 of
        Having a -> return $ Having a
        Done TryAnotherJob -> comp1
        Done Finished -> return $ Done Finished
\end{code}

It is possible to compose a local computation with another computation
and obtain a new local computation.
For that purpose, we prepare \verb@extend@ function.
\begin{code}
extend :: Thread t =>
  (K t a -> IO (JobStatus b)) -> K t a -> K t b
extend trans r = K (t, trans r)
\end{code}

Such transformations of local computation can be changed into
transformations of hypersequents.
\begin{code}
infixr 4 -*-

(-*-) :: (Thread t, HyperSequent l, HyperSequent l') =>
            (t -> a -> IO b) -> (l -> IO l') ->
            HCons (K t a) l -> IO (HCons (K t b) l')
(-*-) = progress_ . extend . peek . lmaybe
  where
    lmaybe _ _  (Done x) = return (Done x)
    lmaybe f th (Having x) =  do
      y <- f th x
      return $ Having y

progress_ :: (HyperSequent l, HyperSequent l') =>
            (a -> b) -> (l -> IO l') -> HCons a l ->
            IO (HCons b l')
progress_ hdf tlf (HCons ax bl) = do
  newtl <- tlf bl
  return $ HCons (hdf ax) newtl
\end{code}

In such transformations,
the extending function must receive the result of the previous function.
This is achieved with the help of \verb@peek@ function.
\begin{code}
peek :: Thread t =>
  (t -> JobStatus a -> IO b) -> K t a -> IO b
peek f (K (th, content)) = content >>= f th
\end{code}

The communication rule says two threads compute something, write it to
the shared memory, reads peer's write if possible and then continue
computation. We split a thread's computation into two parts: one part
upto the write and the other from the read operation. The former part is
hidden in the local computation whereas the latter part is stored in the
hypersequent so that the types of the latest computation is visible to
the user of the library.
\verb@comm@ stands for communication.  \verb@comm@ combines two hypersequents with
a communicating component from each hypersequent.
It can be used in the form
\verb@comm hypersequent1 error1 hypersequent2 error2@ where \verb@error1@ and
\verb@error2@ specifies what to do in case of read failure.
\begin{code}

\section{Capturing Waitfreedom}

Since this paper presents a library for waitfree computation, it is
desirable that only waitfree computation can be implemented using this
library (soundness), and all waitfree computation can be implemented
using this library (completeness).

\subsection{Soundness}

In the library code, the worker threads only use non-blocking \verb@MVar@
operations (a blocking operation \verb@readMVar@ is used but by the main thread).
This ensures that only waitfree computation can be implemented using this
library unless the user uses other communication primitives explicitly.

\subsection{Completeness}

 \caption{An implementation for participating set problem~\citep{participating} for three
 threads.}
 \label{fig:complete}
\end{figure*}


We show the completeness by solving a problem called
the participating set problem appearing in \citet{participating}.
The participating set problem, threads obtain no input except their own
id's.
Each thread~$i$ outputs a set~$S_i$ of thread id's satisfying the
following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $i\in S_i$,
 \item $S_i\subseteq S_j$ or $S_j\subseteq S_i$ for any $i,j$
 \item $i\in S_j$ implies $S_i\subseteq S_j$.
\end{enumerate}
We can solve any waitfree protocol by repeating solving a finite number
of the participating set problem instances.

Intuitively, this can be achieved by making every thread write its id to
the shared memory and then read others' writes from the shared memory.
The results are determined by competition among the threads.
Thread~$i$'s output~$S_i$ contains those threads that has already
written by the time $i$ reads.
However, we have to decompose this intuitive solution into pieces of
two-thread communication.

As an example, we treat the three-thread case.  The three threads are
named \verb@ZeroT@, \verb@FirstT@ and \verb@SecondT@.
This time, we do not follow all the details but just look at the types.

First, each thread computes its own id and stores it in a tuple.
\begin{spec}
hOwnId :: Thread t => IO (K t (t, t) :*: HNil)
\end{spec}
Then, \verb@ZeroT@ and \verb@FirstT@ compete.  This results in the
following hypersequent, which means that either \verb@ZeroT@ obtains
\verb@FirstT@'s id or \verb@FirstT@ obtains \verb@ZeroT@'s id.
\begin{spec}
IO (K ZeroT (ZeroT, FirstT) :*:
    K FirstT (FirstT, ZeroT) :*: HNil)
\end{spec}

Before \verb@SecondT@ is put in consideration, we make the first two threads
to duplicate their possessions so that they can retain the possessions
and communicate the possessions at the same time.
\begin{spec}
twoBeforeComm :: IO (
                        K ZeroT ((ZeroT, FirstT), (ZeroT, FirstT)) :*:
                        K FirstT ((FirstT, ZeroT), (FirstT, ZeroT)) :*:
                        HNil)
\end{spec}

After \verb@SecondT@ competes with \verb@ZeroT@, we obtain the following
hypersequent.  \verb@FirstT@'s possessions are not changed, but \verb@ZeroT@ and
\verb@SecondT@ tries to exchange their possessions.
\begin{spec}
three__ :: IO
  (K FirstT ((FirstT, ZeroT), (FirstT, ZeroT)) :*:
   K ZeroT ((ZeroT, FirstT), SecondT) :*:
   K SecondT (SecondT, (ZeroT, FirstT)) :*: HNil)
\end{spec}
Again, \verb@SecondT@ competes with \verb@FirstT@.  This makes a hypersequent with
any component containing all threads.  Since at least one component succeeds,
at least one thread obtain all threads' ids.

However, the participating set problem requires more.  The following
output does not conform to the problem although one thread has obtained
all threads' ids.  Either $S_0 \subseteq S_2$ or $S_2\subseteq S_0$ is
required but neither is satisfied.
\begin{verbatim}
Thread 1: obtained [1,0,2]
Thread 0: obtained [0]
Thread 2: obtained [2]
\end{verbatim}
In this case threads 0 and 2 have to compete in order to decide which
is later.  In general, either \verb@ZeroT@--\verb@SecondT@ or
\verb@FirstT@--\verb@SecondT@ competition is required so we do both and
concatenate the three competitions as one derivation.
Both of the two thread competition is similar to the simplest nontrivial
waitfree protocol already explained so we omit the details.  The whole
program is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:complete}.
\begin{spec}
main :: IO ()
main = execute $three `follows` twoMid `follows` twoLast
\end{spec}


\section{Comparison with G\"odel--Dummett logic}


\subsection{Similarity}

There are many functional programming languages (OCaml, Haskell, Clean
etc.) that employs intuitionistic logic for their type systems.
The hypersequent formulation that we employed is very similar to that of
G\"odel--Dummett logic, which is among
intermediate logics~\citep{umezawa} between intuitionistic and
classical logics.

G\"odel--Dummett logic (\citet{dummett59}) was originally introduced as a logic
obtained by adding axioms of the form
$(\varphi\rightarrow\psi)\vee(\psi\rightarrow\varphi)$ to
intuitionistic propositional logic.　　

\citet{avron91} proposed an alternative formulation of the same logic.
 Instead of the axioms
 $(\varphi\rightarrow\psi)\vee(\psi\rightarrow\varphi)$, he included
the ``communication rule'' on hypersequent derivations:
\begin{center}
 \AxiomC{$\hyper_0\hmid {\Gamma_0, \Delta_0} \vdash {\varphi_0}$}
 \AxiomC{$\hyper_1\hmid {\Gamma_1, \Delta_1} \vdash {\varphi_1}$}
 \BinaryInfC{$\hyper_0\hmid\hyper_1\hmid {\Gamma_0},{\Delta_1}\vdash
 {\varphi_0}\hmid {\Gamma_1},{\Delta_0}\vdash {\varphi_1}$}
 \DisplayProof
\end{center}
where $\Gamma_i$ and $\Delta_i$ are finite sets of formulas.
This communication rule inspired me to model waitfree computation using
hypersequents by using a rule
\begin{center}
\begin{center}
 \AxiomC{$\hyper_0\hmid\mathtt{K t a}$}
 \AxiomC{$\hyper_1\hmid\mathtt{K s b}$}
 \BinaryInfC{$\hyper_0\hmid\hyper_1\hmid \mathtt{K t b}\hmid \mathtt{K s a}$}
 \DisplayProof
\end{center}
\end{center}

He has proved that a  sequent
derivable with cut rules is also provable without cuts
(Gentzen's proof adopted).
However, he still wanted to see what the corresponding typed lambda
calculus looks like, saying ``it seems to us extremely important to determine the exact
       computational content of them~[intermediate logics] ---
       and {to develop corresponding `$\lambda$-calculi'} ''~\citep{avron91}.
Since we are working on a constructive logic, it is natural to ask what
chooses the left or right a term of the type
$(\varphi\supset\psi)\vee(\psi\supset\varphi)$.


\subsection{Difference}

G\"odel--Dummett logic does not have modalities.  Its formulas are the
same as intuitionistic or classical logic.  The only difference of
G\"odel--Dummett logic from intuitionistic logic is that more formulas
are provable in G\"odel--Dummett
logic than in intuitionistic logic.  So, if we want to encode G\"odel--Dummett
logic faithfully, we do not have to introduce modalities such as \verb@K t@.
Even without such modalities, we can regard each component of a
hypersequent as a thread. However,
If we abandon modalities and regard components of a hypersequent as
threads, the participating set problem cannot be solved because the communication rule
splits the threads into two separate groups and any prior
inter-group communication is prohibited.

This restriction would be OK if we were only interested in making sure that
at least one thread knows every other thread.  However, since the
participating set problem does not allow any two threads to be ignorant
of each other, the \verb@comm@ rule cannot provide enough communication power
to solve participating set problem for the components of a hypersequent.

When we look at the hypersequent derivations as proofs, since we are only
interested in the constructive content, we are only looking at one
successful component.  However, when we regard hypersequent derivations as
communicating threads, we have to look at what every component does, not
only the successful one.  So, the meaning of a hypersequent derivation
should not be exactly
$\left(\bigwedge\Gamma_0\rightarrow\varphi_0\right)\vee\left(\bigwedge\Gamma_1\rightarrow\varphi_1\right)\vee\cdots\vee\left(\bigwedge
\Gamma_n\rightarrow\varphi_n\right)$, which assures at least one component
succeeds.
Rather, it would be a disjunction of all permutations of the components:
i.e., the disjunction of all possible outputs of the participating set problem.
And a permutation of the components can only be represented using a
non-commutative operator.  Is the non-commutative operators of
full Lambek calculus suffice?  If that is the case, there is a hope that
we can study
waitfree computation more closely using a substructural logic without
modalities.
However, it would require linear types to implement such treatments of
waitfreedom.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Computational Content of Hypersequents}

\citet{RM} proposed the hypersequent calculus for obtaining
cut-free deduction system for \textbf{RM}.
He also obtained cut-free hypersequent calculus for G\"odel--Dummett
logic.
\citet*{alg} proved that there exists a cut-free hypersequent calculus
for each logic that can be characterized by a ``simple enough'' axiom on
top of intuitionistic propositional logic.  The class of ``simple
enough'' axioms are called $\mathcal N_3$.  It contains infinitely many
logical formulas including well-known axioms like weak excluded
middle~$\neg\varphi\vee\neg\neg\varphi$,
prelinearity~$(\varphi\rightarrow\psi)\vee(\psi\rightarrow\varphi)$ and so on.

\citet{parallel} developed a so-called parallel dialogue games.  It is
based on Lorenzen dialogue .  It is basically proof searching from
bottom to up with player supposed
to know the answer proof tree and opponent directing for different parts
of the proof.  Since the game rules are translation of hypersequent
calculus, the global game state has local parts.  And the player can,
for example, duplicate a local part into two.  This is essentially
different from the typed lambda calculi computation because the games
give meanings to only normal form proofs while the typed lambda calculi
give meanings to all proofs.

\subsection{High Level Treatment of Concurrency}

Erlang~\citep{erlang} is a programming language designed for concurrency
using Actor
model by~\citet{actor}.
Since Actor model separates the sender of a message from the message
itself, it provides some asynchrony.  However, in Actor model and in
Erlang, a thread can wait for a message.  Thus, these do not provide
waitfree communication.  If we prohibit waiting in these languages,
we have to prohibit
receiving messages altogether.

% Newsqueak

Asynchronous $\pi$-calculus by \citet{api} is a fragment of
$\pi$-calculus.  It is
similar to the Actor Model in that it is impossible to do something
after sending a message.  However, asynchronous $\pi$-calculus
allows a process to wait for a channel to deliver a message.  Thus,
asynchronous $\pi$-calculus is not waitfree.

Concurrent ML~\citep{concurrentML} ``provides a high-level model of
concurrency.''  However, its basic communication primitives
\texttt{accept} and \texttt{send} are blocking operations so that there
is no fragment of the language capturing waitfreedom.

\citet{Brown} proposed a combinator library for message-passing
programming in Haskell.  However, this work is also for synchronous
communication with blocking operations and there is no way of
obtaining a waitfree
fragment of this library.

Join patterns (first proposed as Join Calculus by \citet{join}) allow
consuming messages from a group of
channels simultaneously.  This involves waiting for a group of channels
so that join patterns do not capture waitfreedom either.

In multi-core and multi-processor environment, synchronous communication
is time-consuming.  Compared with
synchronous communication, waitfreedom can be implemented in a less
time-consuming manner.  Since our library
interface captures waitfreedom, it is possible to build a less
time-consuming implementation for this interface.

\section{Future Work}

\citet*{alg} showed a class of logics can be defined using
hypersequent derivation rules.  It will be interesting to see what kind
of computation is represented by these logics.

The library presented in this paper deals with both waitfree
communication and thread management.  It would be better if we dealt with
these different tasks separately.
 We seek to expand the notion of thread into more complicated
 processes so that we can treat dynamic
 forking and merging threads rather
 than a finite set of threads specified at compile-time.

Although we were able to implement the participating set problem,
the implementation is not short nor symmetric.
There seems to be room for more elegant abstraction for symmetric
protocols such as
a rule contains more than two threads and a more direct embedding of the
participating set problem.

Another remaining task is to formalise the strong normalization theorem
formally in a proof assistant like Coq or Isabelle.
\citet{ttlifting} provided a concise proof of strong normalization of
the natural deduction for
intuitionistic propositional logic, containing disjunction.
Lindley's proof was formalized in Nominal Isabelle by
\citet{Doczkal2009}.
