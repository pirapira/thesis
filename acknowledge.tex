 in ILPS, the University of Amsterdam.
 The author thanks Maarten Marx, Maarten de Rijke and other members of ILPS,
 University of Amsterdam, for
 comfortable environments and stimulating discussions during my stay.
 Especially, working on a heavy problem for months with Alessandro
 Facchini and Evgeny Sherkhonov was a unique training.

 The author thanks Tadeusz Litak for encouragements and
 information on relevant research.
 At the University of Tokyo,
 discussions with Tatsuya Abe, Yoshihiko Kakutani and Masahiro Hamano
 nurtured my taste on formalistic, semantic and graphical approaches.
 Kazuhiko Yamamoto gave me an important advice that I concentrate on the
 thesis for a moment.
 Any word would not be enough for Tae Kotake.
