\chapter{Introduction}

There have been several attempts.
The best thing we can hope is that the computational
interpretation coincides with something we know already.
That is the case indeed.

We extended the Curry--Howard correspondence to G\"odel--Dummett logic.
The Curry--Howard correspondence is \fix{add}

G\"odel--Dummett logic is an intermediate logic \fix{cite} between
classical logic and intuitionistic logic.  Every theorem in
intuitionistic logic is a theorem in G\"odel--Dummet logic and every
theorem in G\"odel--Dummett logic is a theorem in classical logic.
The inclusion is strict.  The law of excluded middle
$\varphi\vee(\varphi\supset \bot)$ is not a theorem in G\"odel--Dummett
logic and $(\varphi\supset\psi)\vee(\psi\supset\varphi)$ is not a
theorem in intuitionistic logic.

Without modalities.


In terms of Kripke semantics, the axiom is sound and complete for
requiring that the models are linearly ordered.
In terms of algebraic semantics, the axiom is sound and complete for
requiring that the truth values are linearly ordered.  \fix{ is this
usage of ``truth values'' correct? }
In terms of computation, what is it?


who said logic is about temporality.
Waitfreedom is a kind of temporality appeared in computer science.
This research shows that the proof theory is not only about abstract notions of temporality, but also about concrete notions of temporality appearing in computer science.

Hypersequents were born to solve proof theoretical difficulties, but we
apply hypersequents to solve distributed computational difficulties.
