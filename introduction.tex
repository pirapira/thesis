\section{Our Contributions}

We propose hyper-lambda calculi.
Instead of lambda terms in ordinary lambda calculi,
we use a finite sequence of lambda terms called hyper-lambda terms.
We give two such examples:
one models synchronous send-receive communication (Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange}) and
the other models asynchronous waitfree
read-write communication (Chapter~\ref{ch:lambda}).
The two hyper-lambda calculi are in Curry-Howard correspondence with
hypersequent formulation of logics: Abelian logic and G\"odel-Dummett
logic.
G\"odel-Dummett logic is an intermediate logic.
An intermediate logic is a logic \textit{between} classical and
intuitionistic logics, where `between' is defined using the
set-theoretic inclusion of valid logical formulae of each logic.
Abelian logic is a substructural logic.

\citet{hosoi-ono} declared that they chose to study intermediate
logics in
general rather than studying specific intermediate logics.
However, concrete results about specific subjects matter when the
results contain new phenomena.
This thesis is intended to contain such concrete discoveries
about specific intermediate and substructural logics.

The more famous logic among the two, G\"odel-Dummett logic, is
a typical intermediate logic known from 1950's.
Our method is the Curry-Howard correspondence, also known from 1940's.
Our result is characterization of waitfreedom, a concept in the theory
of distributed computation extensively studied in 1990's.
Since both sides of the correspondence are already known,
the discovery is a replay of Curry's surprise.

After developing a hyper-lambda calculus for Abelian logic,
we found that the resulting programming language is similar to a
session type systems by \citet{giunti2010} although they were not aware
of the underlying logic.  The independent discoveries constitute
another instance of Curry--Howard correspondence ``not by design''.

We list our contributions from the most important:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item developing a lambda calculus using
       a hypersequent calculus (Chapters~\ref{ch:exchange}, \ref{ch:lambda});
 \item identifying the computational ability of
       G\"odel-Dummett logic with waitfreedom (Chapter~\ref{ch:lambda});
 \item encoding session types using a seemingly unknown axiom
       $(\phi\limp \psi)\otimes(\psi\limp \phi)$ (which we call the Amida axiom) on top
       of the multiplicative additive fragment of intuitionistic linear
       logic (Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange}),
 \item discovery of a new proof system for Abelian logic (Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange});
 \item using conjunctive hypersequents for the first time
       (Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange});
 \item giving a typed lambda calculus for monoidal t-norm logic
       (Chapter~\ref{ch:pole}); and
 \item implementing a hyper-lambda calculus in Haskell (Chapter~\ref{ch:haskell}).
\end{enumerate}

Our first contribution is the technique for our second contribution.
We developed a lambda calculus based on Avron's
hypersequents~\citep{avron91}.
\citet{avron91} himself noted that it would be important to develop a
lambda calculus for hypersequents.
The lambda calculus relies on Avron's hypersequents~\citep{avron91}.
A hypersequent calculus is a
variant of the deduction system called sequent calculus.  In sequent
calculus, each step of a proof tree concludes a sequent $\G\vdash\phi$ that
consists of a finite sequence of logical formulae~$\G$ and a logical
formula~$\phi$.  The sequent $\G\vdash\phi$ is
interpreted as an implication.  In hypersequent calculus, each step of a
proof tree concludes a hypersequent instead of a sequent.  A
\textit{hypersequent}\index{hypersequent}
is a sequence of sequents delimited by $\hmid$, e.g.,
$\G\vdash\phi\hmid \D\vdash\psi
\hmid \cdots$.  Also here, each component is interpreted as an
implication, and then the whole hypersequent is interpreted as the
disjunction of all those implications.
When we interpret proofs as programs, we take the components as
concurrent processes.  Following the original disjunctive
interpretation of components, we regard the proof tree as the guarantee of
success of at least one process.

Our second contribution is the new approach of interpreting proofs in
G\"odel-Dummett logic as
concurrently executable programs for waitfree computation.
Although \citet{avron91} noticed his hypersequent calculus has something
to do with concurrency (as the title of~\citep{avron91} contains the phrase
``intermediate logics for concurrency''), it was unknown that
the computational interpretation of G\"odel-Dummett logic coincides with
the degree of synchronization called waitfreedom.  This discovery
constitutes our second contribution.

According to \citet[p.97]{curryhoward},
the Curry-Howard isomorphism~\citep{curryhoward} was first made
precise by \citet[\textbf{9}E and
\textbf{9}F]{curry1974combinatory}.
The intuitionistic propositional logic and the typed lambda calculus
had been independently invented but Curry discovered them to be the same thing.
The ``double discovery'' (\citet{wadler2012propositions}) is considered
to affirm the importance of the typed lambda calculi.
In this thesis we witness a replay of the ``double discovery'' with
different casts: G\"odel-Dummett logic and the waitfreedom.
Both of these were born in the early eras of their respective academic
disciplines:
mathematical logic bore G\"odel Dummett logic in
1950's~\citep{dummett59}
and the computer science bore waitfree computation in
1970's~\citep{lamport1979make}.
Chapter~\ref{ch:lambda} is about the previously unknown connection
between these two.

This is the first such computational
interpretation for intermediate logics (Figure~\ref{fig:lattice}).
Another significance of this contribution
lies in giving interpretation of nondterminism in typed
lambda calculi as scheduling of concurrent processes.
In the simply typed lambda calculus for intuitionistic
propositional logic, all typed terms have a unique normal form.
However, in typed lambda calculi for classical propositional logic,
there can be multiple normal forms unless we employ an evaluation
strategy or limit the set of reductions.
The lack of unique normal forms in the classical propositional proofs
has puzzled logicians for decades.
The most famous example is Lafont's
example~\citep[B.1.]{girard1989proofs}, which provides a way to equate
any two proofs for the same formula (if we equate proofs before and
after cut-elimination).
In computer science, such a phenomenon is called nondeterminism caused by scheduling.

Dynamic behaviour involves time.
One simple notion of time is that of totally ordered events where
one event happens before the other or the other before the one.
This sentence is syntactically similar to Dummett's axiom that states
one proposition implies the other or the other implies the one.
We investigate whether this syntactic similarity is reflected
in the dynamic semantics of logics: namely, the lambda calculi.

Our third contribution is about encoding of session types into a linear
type system.  Although the approach is similar to that of \citet{pfenning2010} and
\citet{wadler2012propositions}, the Amida calculus has an
additional axiom so that it can type some processes that Pfenning or
Wadler's type systems cannot.

Our fourth contribution is a side effect of the third contribution.
The type system we developed for our third contribution is an
unknown proof system for Abelian logic~\citep{casari1989}.
We moreover take the essence of the new proof system and obtain a kind
of proof nets called the Amida nets.
Syntactically, the correct proof structure can be characterized with
the Amida edges, which is similar to the structure of Amida lottery.
The previous chapters gave the computational interpretations of
disjunctive formulae like $(\phi\imp\psi)\lor(\psi\imp\phi)$ or
$(\phi\limp\psi)\oplus(\psi\limp\phi)$.  In this chapter, we try
replacing these disjunctions with conjunctions.
In the former case, the change renders the logic inconsistent;
if we add the axiom $(\phi\imp\psi)\land(\psi\imp\phi)$ to the
intuitionistic propositional logic,
we can prove any formula.  However in the latter case, the change does
not make the system meaningless.
In Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange}, we introduce
the axioms of the form $(\phi\limp\psi)\otimes(\psi\limp\phi)$
on top of IMALL, intuitionistic
multiplicative additive linear
logic.  In essence, the axiom allows two processes to wait for one
another and then exchange information.

Our fifth contribution is the use of conjunctive hypersequents.
Hypersequents have been around since \citet{avron91}, but
in all cases, different components in a hypersequent were interpreted
disjunctively.
In our formalization of Abelian logic in Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange},
we use conjunctive hypersequents, where different components are
interpreted conjunctively.
This is the first application of such conjunctive hypersequents.

Our sixth contribution is a typed lambda calculus for monoidal
t-norm logic.  Monoidal t-norm logic (MTL) is the affine version of
G\"odel-Dummett logic.
MTL is considered by some to be the weakest fuzzy logic.
Following our method of interpreting G\"odel-Dummett logic proofs as
waitfree protocols, we interpret the MTL proofs in our deduction system
as asynchronously communicating processes.
There we employ the second-order formulation and perform parametricity
arguments.

Our seventh contribution is implementing a hyper-lambda calculus in
Haskell.
By implementing a hyper-lambda calculus for waitfreedom,
we obtain a empirical justification of our second contribution.

The content of Chapter~\ref{ch:lambda} appears in
a conference paper by the author \citep{hiraiflops2012}
although we have applied substantial modifications since then.
