\subsection{Our Contributions}

We propose hyper-lambda calculi.
Instead of lambda terms in ordinary lambda calculi,
we use a finite sequence of lambda terms called hyper-lambda terms.
We give two such examples:
one models synchronous send--receive communication (Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange}) and
the other models asynchronous waitfree
read--write communication (Chapter~\ref{ch:lambda}).
We also give an example of hyper-lambda calculi style programming in Haskell.
The two hyper-lambda calculi are in Curry--Howard correspondence with
hypersequent formulation of logics: Amida logic and G\"odel--Dummett
logic.
G\"odel--Dummett logic is an intermediate logic.
An intermediate logic is a logic \textit{between} classical and
intuitionistic logics, where `between' is defined using the
set-theoretic inclusion of valid logical formulae of each logic.
Amida logic is a substructural logic.

\citet{hosoi-ono} declared that they chose to study intermediate
logics in
general rather than studying specific intermediate logics.
However, concrete results about specific subjects matter when the
results contain new phenomena.
This thesis is intended to contain such concrete discoveries
about specific intermediate and substructural logics.

The famous logic among th two,
G\"odel--Dummett logic, is
a typical intermediate logic logic known from 1950's.
Our method is the Curry--Howard correspondence, also known from 1940's.
Our result is characterization of waitfreedom, a concept in the theory
of distributed computation extensively studied in 1990's.
Since both sides of the correspondence is already known,
the discovery is a replay of Curry's surprise.

Of course, there have been many instances of Curry--Howard correspondence.

We list our contributions from the most important:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item developing a lambda calculus using
       a hypersequent calculus (Chapters~\ref{ch:lambda,ch:exchange});
 \item identifying the computational ability of the
       G\"odel--Dummett logic with waitfreedom (Chapter~\ref{ch:lambda});
 \item encoding session types using a seemingly unknown axiom
       $(p\limp q)\otimes(q\limp p)$ (which we call Amida axiom) on top
       of intuitionistic linear logic (Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange}),
 \item discovery of Amida logic (Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange});
 \item using conjunctive hypersequents for the first time (Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange}).
\end{enumerate}

Our first contribution is the technique for our first contribution.
We developed a lambda calculus based on \citet{avron91}'s hypersequents.
\citet{avron91} himself noted that it would be important to develop a
lambda calculus for hypersequents.
The lambda calculus relies on \citet{avron91}'s hypersequents.
The hypersequent calculus is a
variant of the deduction system called sequent calculus.  In sequent
calculus, each step of a proof tree concludes a sequent $\G\vdash\phi$ that
consists of a finite sequence of logical formulae~$\G$ and a logical
formula~$\phi$.  The sequent $\G\vdash\phi$ is
interpreted as an implication.  In hypersequent calculus, each step of a
proof tree concludes a hypersequent instead of a sequent.  A
hypersequent is a sequence of sequents delimited by $\hmid$:
$\G\vdash\phi\hmid \D\vdash\psi
\hmid \cdots$.  Also here, each component is interpreted as an
implication, and then the whole hypersequent is interpreted as the
disjunction of all those implications.
When we interpret proofs as programs, we take the components as
concurrent processeses.  Following the original disjunctive
interpretation of components, we regard the proof tree as the guarantee of
success of at least one process.

Our second contribution is finding a way to interpret proofs in
G\"odel--Dummett logic as
concurrently executable programs for waitfree computation.
Although \citet{avron91} noticed his hypersequent calculus has something
to do with concurrency (as the title of~\citep{avron91} contains the phrase
``intermediate logics for concurrency''), it was unknown that
the computational interpretation of G\"odel--Dummett logic has
the degree of synchronization called waitfreedom.  This discovery
constitutes our first contribution.

According to \citet[p.97]{curryhoward},
the Curry--Howard isomorphism~\citep{curryhoward} was first made
precise by \citet[\textbf{9}E and
\textbf{9}F]{curry1974combinatory}.
The intuitionistic propositional logic and the typed lambda calculus
had been independently invented but Curry discovered them to be the same thing.
The ``double discovery'' (\citet{wadler2012propositions}) is considered
to affirm the importance of the typed lambda calculi.
In this thesis we witness a replay of the ``double discovery'' with
different casts: G\"odel--Dummett logic and the waitfreedom.
Both of these were born in the early eras of their respective academic
disciplines:
mathematical logic bore G\"odel Dummett logic in
1950's~\citep{dummett59}
and the computer science bore waitfree computation in
1970's~\citep{lamport1979make}.
Chapter~\ref{ch:exchange} is about the unknown connection between these two.

This is the first such computational
interpretation for intermediate logics (Fig.~\ref{fig:lattice}).
Another significance of this contribution
is giving interpretation of nondterminism in typed
lambda calculi.  In the simply typed lambda calculus for intuitionistic
propositional logic, all typed terms have a unique normal form.
However, in typed lambda calculi for classical propositional logic,
there can be multiple normal forms unless we employ an evaluation
strategy or limit the set of reductions.
The lack of unique normal forms in the classical propositional proofs
has puzzled logicians for decades. \fix{mention Lafont's example; say it
is a matter of concurrency}

\fix{turn this into a table, linear or intuitionistic, conjunction or disjunction}
The previous works treated the computational interpretations of
disjunctive formulae like $(\phi\imp\psi)\lor(\psi\imp\phi)$ or
$(\phi\limp\psi)\oplus(\psi\limp\phi)$.  In this chapter, we try
replacing these disjunctions with conjunctions.
In the former case, the change renders the logic inconsistent.
If we add the axiom $(\phi\imp\psi)\land(\psi\imp\phi)$ to the
intuitionistic propositional logic,
we can prove any formula.  However in the lattar case, the change does
not make the system meaningless.
In this chapter, we treat
the axioms of the form $(\phi\limp\psi)\otimes(\psi\limp\phi)$
on top of IMLL2, the second order formulation of intuitionistic
multiplicative linear
logic.  In essence, the axiom allows two processes to wait for one
another and then exchange information.

The content of Chapter~\ref{ch:lambda} appears in
a conference paper by the author \citep{hiraiflops2012}
although we have applied substantial modifications since then.
