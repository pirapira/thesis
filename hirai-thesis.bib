States of a machine are chemical solutions where floating molecules can interact according to reaction rules. Solutions can be stratified by encapsulating subsolutions within membranes that force reactions to occur locally. We illustrate the use of this model by describing the operational semantics of the TCCS and CCS process calculi and of the fragment of Milner, Parrow and Walker's Calculus of Mobile Processes used by Milner to encode the lambda-calculus. We also give ideas on how to extract a higher-order concurrent $l$-calculus out of the basic concepts of the chemical abstract machine.},

Built on Milner's work on $\pi$ -calculus, the communication primitive of the formal system is purely based on asynchronous communication, which makes it unique among various concurrency formalisms. Computationally this results in a consistent reduction of Milner's calculus, while retaining the same expressive power. Seen semantically asynchronous communication induces a surprisingly different framework where bisimulation is strictly more general than its synchronous counterpart. This paper shows basic construction of the formal system along with several illustrative examples.},

We present a number of results using hypersequents to obtain a Gentzen-style characterization for the family of G\"odel logics. We first describe analytic calculi for propositional finite and infinite-valued G\"odel logics. We then show that the framework of hypersequents allows one to move straightforwardly from the propositional level to first-order as well as propositional quantification. A certain type of modality, enhancing the expressive power of G\"odel logic, is also considered.}

	abstract = {Real multiprocessors do not provide the sequentially consistent memory that is assumed by most work on semantics and verification. Instead, they have relaxed memory models, typically described in ambiguous prose, which lead to widespread confusion. These are prime targets for mechanized formalization. In previous work we produced a rigorous x86-CC model, formalizing the Intel and AMD architecture specifications of the time, but those turned out to be unsound with respect to actual hardware, as well as arguably too weak to program above. We discuss these issues and present a new x86-TSO model that suffers from neither problem, formalized in HOL4. We believe it is sound with respect to real processors, reflects better the vendors intentions, and is also better suited for programming. We give two equivalent definitions of x86-TSO: an intuitive operational model based on local write buffers, and an axiomatic total store ordering model, similar to that of the SPARCv8. Both are adapted to handle x86-specific features. We have implemented the axiomatic model in our memevents tool, which calculates the set of all valid executions of test programs, and, for greater confidence, verify the witnesses of such executions directly, with code extracted from a third, more algorithmic, equivalent version of the definition.},

We illustrate the use of this model by describing the operational semantics of the TCCS and CCS process calculi and of the fragment of Milner, Parrow and Walker's Calculus of Mobile Processes used by Milner to encode the lambda-calculus. We also give ideas on how to extract a higher-order concurrent $l$-calculus out of the basic concepts of the chemical abstract machine.},

	abstract = {In the celebrated G\"odel Prize winning papers, Herlihy, Shavit, Saks and Zaharoglou gave topological characterization of waitfree computation. In this paper, we characterize waitfree communication logically. First, we give an intuitionistic epistemic logic k  for asynchronous communication. The semantics for the logic k  is an abstraction of Herlihy and Shavits topological model. In the same way Kripke model for intuitionistic logic informally describes an agent increasing its knowledge over time, the semantics of k  describes multiple agents passing proofs around and developing their knowledge together. On top of the logic k , we give an axiom type that characterizes sequential consistency on shared memory. The advantage of intuitionistic logic over classical logic then becomes apparent as the axioms for sequential consistency are meaningless for classical logic because they are classical tautologies. The axioms are similar to the axiom type for prelinearity (   $\psi$ )  ( $\psi$   ). This similarity reflects the analogy between sequential consistency for shared memory scheduling and linearity for Kripke frames: both require total order on schedules or models. Finally, under sequential consistency, we give soundness and completeness between a set of logical formulas called waitfree assertions and a set of models called waitfree schedule models.},

	abstract = {Real multiprocessors do not provide the sequentially consistent memory that is assumed by most work on semantics and verification. Instead, they have relaxed memory models, typically described in ambiguous prose, which lead to widespread confusion. These are prime targets for mechanized formalization. In previous work we produced a rigorous x86-CC model, formalizing the Intel and AMD architecture specifications of the time, but those turned out to be unsound with respect to actual hardware, as well as arguably too weak to program above. We discuss these issues and present a new x86-TSO model that suffers from neither problem, formalized in HOL4. We believe it is sound with respect to real processors, reflects better the vendors intentions, and is also better suited for programming. We give two equivalent definitions of x86-TSO: an intuitive operational model based on local write buffers, and an axiomatic total store ordering model, similar to that of the SPARCv8. Both are adapted to handle x86-specific features. We have implemented the axiomatic model in our memevents tool, which calculates the set of all valid executions of test programs, and, for greater confidence, verify the witnesses of such executions directly, with code extracted from a third, more algorithmic, equivalent version of the definition.},

As a corollary of confluence we obtain decidability for the extensional equational theory of simply-typed $l$ -calculus extended with sum types. Unlike previous decidability results, which rely on advanced rewriting techniques or advanced category theory, we only use standard techniques.},

We provide a term language for a presentation of LK (with conjunction, disjunction, and negation), and we transcribe cut elimination as (non confluent) rewriting. A key slogan, which may appear here in print for the first time, is that commutative cut elimination rules are explicit substitution propagation rules. We then describe the focalised proof search discipline (in the classical setting), and narrow down the language and the rewriting rules to a confluent calculus (a variant of the second authors focalising system L ). We then define a game of patterns and counterpatterns, leading us to a fully focalised finitary syntax for a synthetic presentation of classical logic, that provides a quotient on (focalised) proofs, abstracting out the order of decomposition of negative connectives.},

In particular we consider the logics characterized by Kripke models of bounded width Bwk, by Kripke models of bounded cardinality Bck and by linearly ordered Kripke models of bounded cardinality Gk. The latter family of logics coincides with finitevalued G\"{o}del logics. Our calculi turn out to be very simple and natural. Indeed, for each family of logics (respectively, Bwk, Bck and Gk), they are defined by adding just one structural rule to a common system, namely the hypersequent calculus for Intuitionistic Logic. This structural rule reflects in a natural way the characteristic semantical features of the corresponding logic.}

	abstract = {We propose  - lifting as a technique for extending operational predicates to Moggis monadic computation types, independent of the choice of monad. We demonstrate the method with an application to Girard-Tait reducibility, using this to prove strong normalisation for the computational metalanguage $l$ ml . The particular challenge with reducibility is to apply this semantic notion at computation types when the exact meaning of computation (stateful, side-effecting, nondeterministic, etc.) is left unspecified. Our solution is to define reducibility for continuations and use that to support the jump from value types to computation types. The method appears robust: we apply it to show strong normalisation for the computational metalanguage extended with sums, and with exceptions. Based on these results, as well as previous work with local state, we suggest that this leap-frog approach offers a general method for raising concepts defined at value types up to observable properties of computations.}

	abstract = {Using labelled formulae, a cut-free sequent calculus for intuitionistic propositional logic is presented, together with an easy cut-admissibility proof; both extend to cover, in a uniform fashion, all intermediate logics characterised by frames satisfying conditions expressible by one or more geometric implications. Each of these logics is embedded by the G\"{o}delMcKinseyTarski translation into an extension of S4 . Faithfulness of the embedding is proved in a simple and general way by constructive proof-theoretic methods, without appeal to semantics other than in the explanation of the rules.},

	abstract = {A novel countermodel-producing decision procedure that applies to several multi-modal logics, both intuitionistic and classical, is presented. Based on backwards search in labeled sequent calculi, the procedure employs a novel termination condition and countermodel construction. Using the procedure, it is argued that multi-modal variants of several classical and intuitionistic logics including K, T, K4, S4 and their combinations with D are decidable and have the finite model property. At least in the intuitionistic multi-modal case, the decidability results are new. It is further shown that the countermodels produced by the procedure, starting from a set of hypotheses and no goals, characterize the atomic formulas provable from the hypotheses.}

	abstract = {Formal systems of fuzzy logic (including the well-known ukasiewicz and G\"{o}delDummett infinite-valued logics) are well-established logical systems and respected members of the broad family of the so-called substructural logics closelyrelated to the famous logic BCK. The study of fragments of logical systems is an important issue of research in any class of non-classical logics. Here we study the fragments of nine prominent fuzzy logics to all sublanguages containing implication. However, the results achieved in the paper for those nine logics are usually corollaries of theorems with much wider scope of applicability. In particular, we show how many of these fragments are really distinct and we find axiomatic systems for most of them. In fact, we construct strongly separable axiomatic systems for eight of our nine logics. We also fully answer the question for which of the studied fragments the corresponding class of algebras forms a variety. Finally, we solve the problem how to axiomatize predicate versions of logics without the lattice disjunction (an essential connective in the usual axiomatic system of fuzzy predicate logics).}

In this paper we investigate a weaker logic, MTL, which is intended to cope with the tautologies of left-continuous t-norms and their residua. The corresponding algebraic structures, MTL-algebras, are defined and completeness of MTL with respect to linearly ordered MTL-algebras is proved. Besides, several schematic extensions of MTL are also considered as well as their corresponding predicate calculi.},

	abstract = {We present a sound and complete proof technique, based on syntactic logical relations, for showing contextual equivalence of expressions in a $l$ -calculus with recursive types and impredicative universal and existential types. Our development builds on the step-indexed PER model of recursive types presented by Appel and McAllester. We have discovered that a direct proof of transitivity of that model does not go through, leaving the PER status of the model in question. We show how to extend the Appel-McAllester model to obtain a logical relation that we can prove is transitive, as well as sound and complete with respect to contextual equivalence. We then augment this model to support relational reasoning in the presence of quantified types. Step-indexed relations are indexed not just by types, but also by the number of steps available for future evaluation. This stratification is essential for handling various circularities, from recursive functions, to recursive types, to impredicative polymorphism. The resulting construction is more elementary than existing logical relations which require complex machinery such as domain theory, admissibility, syntactic minimal invariance, and  -closure.},
