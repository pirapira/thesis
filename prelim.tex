  \subsection{Preliminaries and Notations}

  We assume inductive definitions using BNF and coinductive definition.
  $\powerset X$ denotes the powerset of $X$.
  For a symbol or a sequence of symbols $p$,
  $p^+$ denotes repetition of $p$ more than zero times and
  $p^*$ denotes repetition of $p$ more than or equal to zero times.

  In the first chapters, agents appear.  Later, processes.  Processes
  are special agents.
