We extended the Curry--Howard correspondence to G\"odel--Dummett logic.
The Curry--Howard correspondence is \fix{add}

G\"odel--Dummett logic is an intermediate logic \fix{cite} between
classical logic and intuitionistic logic.  Every theorem in
intuitionistic logic is a theorem in G\"odel--Dummet logic and every
theorem in G\"odel--Dummett logic is a theorem in classical logic.
The inclusion is strict.  The law of excluded middle
$\varphi\vee(\varphi\supset \bot)$ is not a theorem in G\"odel--Dummett
logic and $(\varphi\supset\psi)\vee(\psi\supset\varphi)$ is not a
theorem in intuitionistic logic.
